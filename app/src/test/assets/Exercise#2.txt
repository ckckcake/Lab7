In your course project, identify three (3) opportunities for refactoring and which of the refactoring tools we've covered here (or others documented here!) would be helpful for doing so.

You should include in your responses why you would perform these refactorings, or at least be ready to explain to a TA.

You don't need to actually perform or push these changes now. When your team next meets however,
you should take a moment to discuss all of the (possibly up to 18!) refactoring opportunities you identified, and decide which ones you may want to actually apply to your project.

The check-off form has been modified to accommodate this exercise. You can provide three short paragraph answers (with links to your code in GitHub).
There is also a field for you to include a Google Drive folder if you would prefer to provide screenshots.

Some refactorings to consider:
-Extract Method
-Extract Constant
-Extract Class/Interface/Delegate
-Change Signature
-Rename
    -Do not submit three renames. One at most, and you must justify why it's important.
    -You won't be able to check off if you do this.

1) Extract delegates: extracting the search filter method and listview/checkbox content from our adapter class to achieve SRP
2) Change signatures: to match new classes and parameter inputs
3) Observer pattern: use this to notify about changes in search input for listview/checkbox to update accordingly
